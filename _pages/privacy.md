## Information We Collect


We collect personal information that you provide to us directly, such as your name, email address, and payment information. We also collect information about your use of our website, such as the pages you visit and the actions you take. We may also collect information from third-party sources, such as social media platforms, to improve the functionality and personalization of our website.

## How We Use Your Information


We use the personal information we collect to provide you with the services you request, such as booking a holiday or managing your account. We may also use your information to communicate with you, such as to send confirmation emails or notifications about your bookings. We may also use your information for internal purposes, such as to improve the quality and functionality of our website, or to analyze user behavior and preferences.

## Sharing Your Information


We do not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. However, we may share your information with service providers who assist us in providing the services you request, such as payment processors or email marketing providers. We may also share your information in response to legal requirements, such as a subpoena or court order, or in other circumstances where we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our customers, or others.

## Security


We take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no website or internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
